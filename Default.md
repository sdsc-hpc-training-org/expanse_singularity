### Introduction

### What is Singularity?

> \"Singularity enables users to have full control of their environment.
> Singularity containers can be used to package entire scientific
> workflows, software and libraries, and even data. This means that you
> don\'t have to ask your cluster admin to install anything for you -
> you can put it in a Singularity container and
> run.\"^[1](#footnote1){#ref1}^
