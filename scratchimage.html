<p>Singularity supports an image format that is writable called the sandbox format (a directory), ideal for the development process.</p> 
 
<p>The following command creates a directory called ubuntu/ with an entire Ubuntu OS in the current working directory.</p>
 
<pre>sudo singularity build --sandbox ubuntu/ library://ubuntu</pre><br />
 
<p>To modify the contents of the directory use <code>--writable</code> option. For example, the following creates a file named test.</p>
<pre>sudo singularity exec --writable ubuntu touch /test</pre><br />
 
<p>Convert the sandboxed image to the default immutable image format (Singularity Image File - sif):</p>
<pre>singularity build ubuntu.sif ubuntu</pre>
