<p>If you have access to the Jetstream2 cloud service and are already familiar with how to use it, it could be a good option to build Singularity containers there instead of on a laptop. Consider in particular that complicated containers like PyTorch or Tensorflow take hours to build.</p>
<p>Login to <a href="https://jetstream2.exosphere.app" class="uri">https://jetstream2.exosphere.app</a> with your ACCESS credentials. Under the Create button choose “SSH Public key” and paste the key you will be using to SSH into the Virtual Machine.</p>
<p>Under the Create button choose “Instance”, choose Ubuntu 22.04 as OS.</p>
<p>Choose at least a <code>m3.quad</code> which has 4 vCPUs and 15 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Open the advanced options and select the key you just uploaded.</p>
<p>Wait for the VM to build, access the details to find out the public IP, then SSH with:</p>
<pre><code>ssh ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</code></pre>
<p>In order to avoid warnings during the Singularity build process, it is better to restart the Virtual Machine:</p>
<pre><code>sudo reboot</code></pre>
