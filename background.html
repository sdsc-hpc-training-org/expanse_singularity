<p>Below is a typical list of commands you would need to issue in order to implement a functional Python installation for scientific research:</p>
<pre><code>COMMAND=apt-get -y install libx11-dev
COMMAND=apt-get install build-essential python-libdev
COMMAND=apt-get install build-essential openmpi-dev
COMMAND=apt-get install cmake
COMMAND=apt-get install g++
COMMAND=apt-get install git-lfs
COMMAND=apt-get install libXss.so.1
COMMAND=apt-get install libgdal1-dev libproj-dev
COMMAND=apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev libjsoncpp0
COMMAND=apt-get install libmpich-dev --user
COMMAND=apt-get install libpthread-stubs0 libpthread-stubs0-dev libx11-dev libx11-d
COMMAND=apt-get install libudev0:i386
COMMAND=apt-get install numpy
COMMAND=apt-get install python-matplotlib
COMMAND=apt-get install python3</code></pre>
<p>Singularity allows you to avoid this time-consuming series of steps by packaging these commands in a re-usable and editable script, allowing you to quickly, easily, and repeatedly implement a custom container designed specifically for your analytical needs.</p>

<p>Additional features of Singularity include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singularity provides flexibility for a particular OS Environment.</li>
<li>Singularity (http://singularity.lbl.gov)is a relatively new development that has become very popular on XSEDE systems like Expanse.</li>
<li>Singularity allows groups to easily migrate complex software stacks from their campus to XSEDE systems.</li>
<li>Singularity runs in user space, and requires very little special support - in fact it actually reduces it in some cases.</li>
<li>Singularity offers a convenient way to run applications such as Tensorflow, ParaView, Torch, Fenics, and custom user applications.</li>
<li>Docker images can be imported into Singularity.</li>
</ul>
