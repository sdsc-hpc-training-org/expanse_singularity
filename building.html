<p>For further customization of images, or for building images from scratch, we can either use the free Sylabs build service or we need access to a GNU/Linux machine with <code>root</code> privileges.</p>
<p>Then the Singularity workflow is composed of 3 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the image on the external Linux system</li>
<li>Transfer to Expanse</li>
<li>Run on Expanse via Slurm</li>
</ul>
