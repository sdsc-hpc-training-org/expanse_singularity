<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to enable you to use ACCESS's Expanse supercomputer at <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu">SDSC</a> to run your jobs using Singularity. You will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic familiarity with using Expanse
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/expanse.html">Expanse User Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://education.sdsc.edu/training/interactive/202009_expanse_101/index.php">Getting Started with Expanse</a> tutorial</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An account on Expanse; there are several options if you do not already have an account on Expanse. All of these will require that you first create a free account on the <a href="https://allocations.access-ci.org/">ACCESS User Portal</a>
<ul>
<li>Currently, Expanse is unique in its status as an XSEDE system on which users may request a <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/announcements#trial">trial allocation</a> to evaluate resources</li>
<li>If your research is limited by the limited compute power you have in your research lab, you can request a <a href="https://allocations.access-ci.org/preparing-your-explore-access-request">ACCESS Explore Allocation</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Tutorials on how to get started with Singularity generally do not include details specific to running Singularity on ACCESS systems such as Expanse.</p>
