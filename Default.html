<h3>Introduction</h3>


<h3>What is Singularity?</h3>
<blockquote>&quot;Singularity enables users to have full control of their environment. 
    Singularity containers can be used to package entire scientific workflows, software and libraries, and even data. 
    This means that you don't have to ask your cluster admin to install anything for you - you can put it in a Singularity container 
    and run.&quot;<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></blockquote>
