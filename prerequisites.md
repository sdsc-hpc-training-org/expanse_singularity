### Prerequisites

The purpose of this tutorial is to enable you to use ACCESS\'s Expanse
supercomputer at [SDSC](http://www.sdsc.edu) to run your jobs using Singularity. You will
need the following:

-   Basic familiarity with using Expanse
    -   [Expanse User Guide](https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/expanse.html)
    -   [Getting Started with Expanse](https://education.sdsc.edu/training/interactive/202009_expanse_101/index.php) tutorial
-   An account on Expanse; there are several options if you do not already have an account on Expanse. All of these will require that you first create a free account on the [ACCESS User Portal](https://allocations.access-ci.org/)
    -   Currently, Expanse is unique in its status as an XSEDE system on which users may request a [trial allocation](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/announcements#trial) to evaluate resources
    -   If your research is limited by the limited compute power you have in your research lab, you can request a [ACCESS Explore Allocation](https://allocations.access-ci.org/preparing-your-explore-access-request)

Tutorials on how to get started with Singularity generally do not include details specific to running Singularity on ACCESS systems such as Expanse.
