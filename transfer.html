<h3 id="transfer-the-container-to-expanse">Transfer the Container to Expanse</h3>
<p>Once you have created your container on your local system, you will need to transfer it to Expanse. There are multiple ways to do this and it can take a varying amount of time depending on its size and your network connection speeds.</p>
<p>To do this, we will use scp (secure copy). If you have a Globus account and your containers are more than 4 Gb you will probably want to use that file transfer method instead of scp.</p>
<p>Browse to the directory containing the container. Copy the container to your scratch directory on Expanse. By issuing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>scp ./ ubuntu-anaconda.sif &lt;username&gt;@login.expanse.sdsc.edu:/expanse/lustre/scratch/&lt;username&gt;/temp_project/</code></pre>
<p>The container is ~2GB so it should not take too long, hopefully.</p>
